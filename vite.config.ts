// register that the GC reads as a pointer
// (https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/62393). `vp test` starts Vitest
// itself and NODE_OPTIONS rejects V8 flags, so switch the baseline tier off
// here, where Vitest loads its config. That covers `vp test` from the repo
// root, and only code compiled from here on: what Node compiled while
// starting stays baseline, so this makes the crash rare, not impossible.
// Drop this once the Node release in devEngines carries the backport
// (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/65753).
