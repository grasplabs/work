// A capability is what lets connect act on a call from core without
// trusting core's caller: core checks the permission, then signs exactly
// what it allows (who, for whom, which connection, resource and action,
// which idempotency key) for a few seconds; connect verifies every field
// against the call before it does anything.
//
// The scheme is HMAC-SHA256 with a secret only core and connect hold
// (`CAPABILITY_SIGNING_KEY`), over the token's own payload text:
// `base64url(JSON claims) "." base64url(MAC)`. Both ends are ours and share
// the secret, so a MAC does what a signature would, with less to go wrong.
//
// Replays: connect keeps no record of used capabilities. A capability names
// one exact call and expires quickly, and a side effect is bound to the
// idempotency key it names, so replaying one repeats at most that same call
// within its lifetime, and a write returns its stored result instead of
// running again.
