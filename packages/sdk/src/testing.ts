/**
 * Test harness and dry runs for workflows. Runs a workflow in memory, with
 * the time-skipping and step-mocking of Temporal's test environment:
 *
 * - steps can be mocked by name, or made to fail;
 * - side-effect steps don't run: they're recorded with their input, so a
 *   test asserts what the workflow would change and a dry run reports it;
 * - decisions are answered up front, and a wait for one without an answer
 *   times out right away, as sleeps end right away.
 *
 * Every workflow ships with its tests next to it (`invoice.workflow-tests.ts`
 * beside `invoice.ts`), written with `workflowTests`, and `runWorkflowTests`
 * runs them, so a version whose tests fail is never activated. The suffix
 * isn't `.test.ts`: these aren't Vitest files. Only `workflows/<id>.ts`
 * (an id without dots) is a workflow: put shared code in a folder under
 * workflows/, such as workflows/lib/.
