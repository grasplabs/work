Your App's logic runs in server functions. There are three kinds, and each can do exactly what it needs:

| Kind | Reads data | Writes data | Reaches outside the App |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | yes | no | no |
| `mutation` | yes | yes, all at once when it returns | no |
| `action` | through queries | through mutations | through its permissions |

Grasp enforces this at run time, and the types enforce it as you write: a query has no way to write, and a mutation has no way to call out.

## Arguments and returns

Every function declares its arguments (`args`) and what it returns (`returns`) with `v`. Grasp checks the arguments before the handler runs and the return value after, so a handler only ever sees valid input and a caller only ever gets what was declared.

A function is registered by exporting it from a module under `server/`. Its name is the module's path and the export: `list` in `server/tasks.ts` is `tasks.list`.

## Queries

A query reads through `ctx.db` and returns a value. Pages subscribe to queries, and Grasp sends them the new result whenever the data it read changes.

```ts server/counts.ts
import { v } from "@grasp-os/runtime";
import { query } from "@server/_generated/server";

export const open = query({
  args: {},
  returns: v.number().integer(),
  handler: async (ctx) =>
    await ctx.db
      .query("tasks")
      .withIndex("by_done", (range) => range.eq("done", false))
      .count(),
});
```

## Mutations

A mutation reads and writes through `ctx.db`. Its writes are staged and commit together once it returns: if it throws, nothing is written.

```ts server/edits.ts
import { AppError, v } from "@grasp-os/runtime";
import { mutation } from "@server/_generated/server";

export const rename = mutation({
  args: { id: v.id("tasks"), title: v.string().trim().min(1).max(200) },
  returns: v.null(),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const task = await ctx.db.get("tasks", args.id);
    if (task === null) {
      throw new AppError("task.not_found", "The task is gone.");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch("tasks", task._id, { title: args.title });
    return null;
  },
});
```

Throw `AppError` for a failure the caller should see: a stable, dotted `code` to branch on and a `message` safe to show. Any other error is an unexpected failure to the caller.

A mutation may run more than once: again when what it read changed before it committed, and again when its caller retries it. Each run computes the same thing. Inside a mutation, `Date.now()` and `new Date()` give the time the mutation started, and `Math.random()`, `crypto.randomUUID()` and `crypto.getRandomValues()` give the same values in every run of it. Queries and actions use the real clock and randomness.

## Actions

An action has no `ctx.db`. It composes the App's queries and mutations, each its own call, and reaches outside the App only through the permissions your App declares in `grasp.config.ts`, such as a connection or a workflow it starts.

```ts server/imports.ts
import { v } from "@grasp-os/runtime";
import { action } from "@server/_generated/server";

import { add } from "./tasks.ts";

export const addAll = action({
  args: { titles: v.array(v.string().trim().min(1).max(200)).max(20) },
  returns: v.number().integer(),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    for (const title of args.titles) {
      await ctx.runMutation(add, { title });
    }
    return args.titles.length;
  },
});
```

An action isn't atomic: each mutation it runs commits on its own. When a change depends on what you read, read and write in one mutation instead.

Each action a connection declares is a typed method of `ctx.connections.<alias>`: with `actions: ["send"]` you call `await ctx.connections.mail.send({ ... })`, and an action the connection doesn't declare isn't there. A name with `-` becomes camel case (`send-mail` is `sendMail`). An HTTP connection has `fetch(path, init)` instead, answered as a `Response`. The platform's functions sit under their namespace, such as `await ctx.grasp.statistics.read({ ... })`.

## What a function may use

Every function of your App may use what the App's permissions declare, as its kind allows: an action reaches connections, AI and the Brain and starts workflows, a mutation starts workflows once it commits, and a query only reads. Functions call each other by reference, internal ones included. What each caller reads and writes is decided by the tables' access and row rules, whichever function reads or writes.

## Internal functions

`internalQuery`, `internalMutation` and `internalAction` declare functions that only your App's own code calls: Pages and other callers can't. Reach them from server code through `internal` in `@server/_generated/internal`.

## Who is calling

`ctx.auth.getUser()` tells you who called: their `id`, `name`, `email` and their `roles` in the App (`builder` and `user`). Decide what someone may do here, in the server function, never in a Page.

```ts server/roles.ts
import { v } from "@grasp-os/runtime";
import { query } from "@server/_generated/server";

export const canManage = query({
  args: {},
  returns: v.boolean(),
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUser();
    return user.roles.includes("builder");
  },
});
```

## npm packages

Server functions import the npm packages the App's builder approved by name, as Pages do (see [Pages](/guides/pages)). They run in the App's isolate, which has no network: a package that calls `fetch` fails there. Reach other systems through the App's connections.
