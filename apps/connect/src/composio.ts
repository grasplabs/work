// Composio's REST API, as connect calls it: the only place in Grasp that
// does (threat model CN17). Core reaches Composio only through connect, and
// nothing but connect holds the key, a Worker secret the console sets
// (`COMPOSIO_API_KEY`). While it is unset, nothing of Composio is offered
// or reached.
//
// Each safeguard, and why:
// - The key goes only to Composio's API host: the base URL is fixed here,
//   and a redirect is never followed, since following one would send the
//   key wherever Composio's answer pointed.
// - Everything Composio sends is untrusted. Each answer is read up to a
//   size cap as it arrives (never trusting `content-length`), so a huge or
//   endless answer can't exhaust the isolate, then validated before
//   anything uses it. Names, categories and descriptions are Composio's
//   text: the UI renders them as text, never as markup.
// - Every failure (no answer in time, an error status, a redirect, an
//   oversized or unreadable answer, even a body that won't cancel) ends as
//   one `ComposioError`, so callers fall back as one: the catalog lists the
//   native providers alone.
// - Logs carry the method, the path's first segment and the status: never
//   the key, the query or a body.
