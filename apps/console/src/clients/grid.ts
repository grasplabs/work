 * its errors over the last day, what it cost this month, and where its
 * onboarding stands (onboarding.ts).
 *
 * The live columns are read after the page shows (`gridLive`): a few
 * clients at a time, each within a deadline, with what every client needs
 * (Secrets Store, the analytics of all their accounts, release manifests)
 * read once. Each client's answer is kept for a minute, so reloading the
 * page doesn't read the accounts again. Whatever doesn't answer in time
 * shows as unknown, and is read again the next time: only an answer with
 * nothing unknown in it is kept. Nothing live fails the grid.
