// freezes each workflow's hours as drawn, designed and as it runs, and
// the improvement signals of the App workflows the Playbook links to
// (app/figures.ts), which the workflow map keeps as records (its own
// built-in App, whose types they are). These tests go in through the
// Apps' server methods, as their screens call them, and start from the
// ways it can fail: a number that isn't what the records and runs say (a
// run outside the window counted, the designed version taken for the drawn
// one); a later save, run or day of signals changing a snapshot taken
// before it; a save of the snapshot, by the page or by a person, changing
// what it froze; a signal's subject (a person) or another App's signals
// copied into a record everyone reads; a workflow that no longer reads as
// one, or a designed one never drawn, stopping a snapshot or frozen as
// what it isn't; and someone who may not change the Playbook taking one.
