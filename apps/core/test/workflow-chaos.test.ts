// Workflow runs under failure: crashes mid-step, restarts, long sleeps,
// starts delivered twice, and failures that pass or last. Runs
// are real, on the Workflows engine (Miniflare's). Their side effects go
// through the real connect to a fake mail server (test/mail-server.ts)
// that counts every call that reached it, so a mail sent twice shows
// there; the App's counters (`hitsOf`) show how often a step really ran.
//
// How each failure is brought about, only from outside core:
// - a crash or a deploy stops a run's execution: the engine's own pause,
//   then resume, which runs the workflow again from its start, loaded
//   anew, finished steps replayed (`stopped`, test/runs.ts);
// - an isolate killed mid-step: an attempt that hangs until the engine
//   gives up on it at the step's timeout and tries again; with the call
//   still out, the mail server holds it until the test lets it go;
// - the engine losing a finished step's record: the engine's restart from
//   that step, which runs it again from scratch;
// - a long sleep: a day's sleep, cut short while the run is stopped (the
//   engine's test introspection);
// - a start delivered twice: a second create of the run's instance under
//   its ID (a trigger's duplicate events are for its own tests);
// - a failure trying again may fix: the mail server turning calls away.
// Failures trying again can't fix (a refused call, the workflow's own
// error) stop a run at once: workflows.test.ts has them, with the report
// the run's owner sees.
//
// The tests wait on conditions (a step done, a status reached, a counter
// moved), never for a set time. Step timeouts only cut off attempts made
// to hang, and give a good attempt ample time; the App's code is built
// before such a run, so a first call doesn't spend an attempt building it.
