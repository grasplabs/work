// Workflows are code the agent writes, run for real: committed to an App,

// test helpers skip sleeps; the outside systems faked
// here are the model provider behind AI Gateway, and a mail provider's MCP
// server behind the real connect (test/mail-server.ts).
//
// A run's audit events are in an outbox by the time the run has ended: the
// dispatcher's end step writes the run's own event with its row, and each
// step's and each connection call's event is written before the step goes
// on. `allEvents` drains the outboxes before it reads, so a test reads them
// once, after the run ended, rather than wait for them: a wait with a
// deadline adds nothing, and one read of the log can take longer than a
// short deadline on a loaded runner.
