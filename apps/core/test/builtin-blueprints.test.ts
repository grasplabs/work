// The built-in blueprints: Apps' blueprints that ship with each release,
// installed on the first request (src/builtins.ts) through the App
// registry (src/app-blueprints.ts). These tests start from the ways that
// can fail: a built-in isn't listed, or can't be created from, as any
// blueprint is; a changed release doesn't reach it, writes it twice when
// two installs race, or changes an App already created from it; an
// unchanged release writes again; a failure halfway is recorded as done;
// someone who builds can't find or copy it, a user can, or anyone, an
// admin too, changes, runs, shares or asks permissions for it; a copy
// doesn't ask for what the release declares, or keeps asking once it no
// longer does; and a built-in the release ships doesn't build.
//
// The global setup embeds the tests' own built-in, `hello`
// (test/fixtures/blueprints/), with the release's. The tests of a file
// share their storage, so each test that changes the built-in starts from
// the release, installed again, and ends by installing it again.
