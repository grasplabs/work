// The built-in blueprints: blueprints that ship with each release,

// other (src/app-blueprints.ts). These tests start from the ways that can
// fail: a built-in isn't listed, or can't be created from, as any
// blueprint is; it leaves an App behind that anyone finds, changes, runs,
// shares or asks permissions for; anyone, an admin too, unmarks it; a
// changed release doesn't reach it, is recorded twice when two installs
// race, or changes an App already created from it; an unchanged release
// writes again; a failure halfway is recorded as done; someone who builds
// can't find or copy it, or a user can; a copy doesn't ask for what the
// release declares, or keeps asking once it no longer does; and a
// built-in the release ships doesn't build.
//
// The global setup embeds the tests' own built-in, `hello`
// (test/fixtures/blueprints/), with the release's. The tests of a file
// share their storage, so each test that changes the built-in starts from
// the release, installed again, and ends by installing it again.
