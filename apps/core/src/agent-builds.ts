// Building Apps from a chat: `await env.build.write(app, { ... })`. The
// chat's agent creates Apps (new, or from a blueprint the person may
// create from, by the rules people follow: app-blueprints.ts), and
// changes one in a draft of its own: one per chat and App, kept with the
// chat in its Workspace object (workspace.ts), over the App's latest
// version when it began. A draft reaches the App only as a version, and
// never over a version that changed the same files since it began, so
// the agent's edits and a builder's can't overwrite each other. It checks
// a draft as a save does (screens,
// server code and workflows: type errors, @shadcn/lint and build errors)
// and runs its workflows' tests, and dry-runs them with the values it
// gives. A workflow must call the App's bindings where its step list can
// name each call (`checkWorkflowBindings`): the review of what the agent
// proposes says what each step calls, so a call it couldn't name fails the
// check like a build error, and so does workflow code that reaches for a
// built-in a run is made with (`checkWorkflowModule`). A check also reads
// what the preview of the draft in the person's side panel ran into so far
// (preview-reports.ts): runtime errors fail it as build errors do, so the
// repair loop fixes them within the same limits. The agent can also call
// the draft's server code itself (`call`), in that same preview: its own
// facet and empty database, with stubs that allow nothing, never the
// App's live data (preview.ts). Tests and dry runs run in isolates with
// an empty env: nothing they do leaves them. Once a draft passes, the
// agent proposes it: it becomes the App's next version, pending review,
// with a review of what
// it changes worked out by core (version-review.ts). Nothing here makes a
// version current, or can: a builder of the App does, in Grasp, and what
// the App asks for waits for an admin to grant it.
//
// The repair loop is the agent loop itself: a check answers with what
// fails, the agent writes a fix and checks again, until it passes or
// `maxFailedChecks` checks of one draft failed in a row in one turn, when
// checking refuses and the agent tells the person what still fails. Each
// check takes its place against the limit before it runs (in the
// Workspace object, so checks started at once can't pass it). A turn
// creates at most `maxCreatesPerTurn` Apps. Nothing else of a turn's
// building has a limit of its own: its code runs, and the calls one run may
// make (code-mode.ts), bound the rest, dry runs included, which run in an
// isolate with an empty env and leave nothing behind.
//
// The person's rights bound every call, read again each time: creating an
// App needs a role that builds (and, from a marked blueprint, a role in
// its App), and changing one a builder's role in it.
// The agent needs a permission of its own too: `write` on the Apps
// collection, the company's catalog of Apps, which no one writes as
// Knowledge (it is read only), so granting it means only this. A chat
// that read restricted data writes no App code: what it read would reach
// everyone who builds the App. Every call is audited as `agent.call`, and
// what changes an App (`app.created`, `app.committed`,
// `app.version.proposed`, `permission.requested`) as the agent acting for
// the person.
