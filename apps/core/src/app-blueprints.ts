// Blueprints. A builder of an App marks one of its versions as a
// blueprint; whoever has a role in the App (app-access.ts) and builds
// (an admin or builder in the organization) creates an App of their own
// from it. The new App is theirs. Its first version is the blueprint's
// code, but for its AGENTS.md, and it asks for what the blueprint
// declares, each request waiting for an admin: what the App asked for or
// was given as the version was marked, of the kinds that name the same
// thing for whoever creates from it (`declarableOf` in permissions.ts).
// Its builders ask for the rest themselves. Nothing else comes with it:
// none of the App's data (its storage, its workflows' state, its runs),
// settings (parameter values), members or error log. A version never
// changes, so neither does a blueprint's code.
//
// The copy doesn't inherit what its source may have read
// (app-provenance.ts): it has no sources until an admin grants its
// requests, so whoever it is shared with meanwhile passes the check. So
// its AGENTS.md, which the source's agents write from what they read, is
// not copied but a stub naming the blueprint, for the copy's builders and
// agents to write their own. Every other file a builder stored in the
// code is copied as it is, taken to hold no data: builders must not put
// data into code.
//
// Marking, unmarking and creating are audited, each in the same batch as
// its change. Grasp staff neither mark, unmark nor create from blueprints:
// which Apps get copied is the client's decision, and creating asks for
// permissions, which staff never do for a client.
