// Blueprints: code to create Apps from, each its own record. A builder of
// an App marks one of its versions as a blueprint, which whoever has a
// role in the App (app-access.ts) and builds (an admin or builder in the
// organization) creates an App of their own from. The release ships
// others, the built-ins (apps/core/blueprints/, builtins.ts), which
// everyone who builds creates from, and which only the install changes.
// Either way the new App is theirs, and nothing downstream knows where
// its blueprint came from. Its first version is the blueprint's code, but
// for its AGENTS.md, and it asks for what the blueprint declares, each
// request waiting for an admin: a built-in's `blueprint.json`, or what the
// App asked for or was given as the version was marked, of the kinds
// that name the same thing for whoever creates from it (`declarableOf` in
// permissions.ts). Its builders ask for the rest themselves. Nothing else
// comes with it: none of the App's data (its storage, its workflows'
// state, its runs), settings (parameter values), members or error log.
// A marked blueprint's code is its version's tree, which never changes.
//
// The copy doesn't inherit what its source may have read
// (app-provenance.ts): it has no sources until an admin grants its
// requests, so whoever it is shared with meanwhile passes the check. So
// its AGENTS.md, which the source's agents write from what they read, is
// not copied but a stub naming the blueprint, for the copy's builders and
// agents to write their own. Every other file a builder stored in the
// code is copied as it is, taken to hold no data: builders must not put
// data into code.
//
// Marking, unmarking, installing and creating are audited, each in the
// same batch as its change. Grasp staff neither mark, unmark nor create
// from blueprints: which Apps get copied is the client's decision, and
// creating asks for permissions, which staff never do for a client.
