// Calls between Apps. An App calls another's exports (the server methods
// its `app/exports.json` declares, app-exports.ts) under a permission an
// admin granted it on them: `await this.env.CRM.call(caller, "findCustomers",
// input)` in its server code, `env.CRM.call("findCustomers", input)` in its
// workflows. The call runs on the calling App's permission alone, for the
// person its caller acts for, as a connection call would: whether that
// person has a role in the called App isn't checked. The called App's
// method runs in its own sandbox, with its own permissions, and gets the
// calling App and version on its caller (`caller.app`).
//
// Everything that decides a call is core's, never the calling code's: the
// calling App and the person come from its host's running call (the token
// on the caller), the called App from the permission the stub was built
// from, and the exports from the called App's current version. In order:
//
// - The Apps whose calls are under way (`CallPath.chain`, kept by each
//   host) never include the called App, so no call comes back round, and
//   are at most `appCallLimits.depth` long. Each call ends by the time the
//   first must (`CallPath.deadline`).
// - The export exists in the called App's current version, and the call
//   runs only on that version (`ExportCall.version`): an export removed or
//   changed since is `app.export_not_found` or `app.conflict`, never a call
//   of code nobody checked it against.
// - A call made while serving an export marked `read` calls only exports
//   marked `read` further on (`CallPath.readOnly`): reading can't turn into
//   writing down a chain.
// - The permission allows the export (`authorizeExport`), and one marked
//   `write` only from a version of the calling code an admin approved.
// - The input and the answer are JSON within `appCallLimits`, and match
//   the export's schemas. The called App gets the JSON, nothing else.
// - Restricted mode follows the data both ways, each flag set before the
//   data moves (restricted.ts): a restricted caller restricts the called App
//   before its input reaches it, and a restricted called App restricts the
//   caller before its answer does.
// - Every call is recorded before it runs, on both sides: `app.call` by
//   the calling App (or run) and `app.called` by the called App, in one
//   batch, once the called App's host has pinned the call to the version
//   checked and just before the method runs (`ExportCall.onPinned`); if
//   they can't be stored, nothing is called. One the host refuses before
//   its method runs (another version current, say) is recorded as
//   refused instead. A refusal is
//   recorded as `app.call` with why, a caller the calling App isn't
//   running a call of too.
//
// What the called App's method then does with its own permissions is its
// own: its connections and collections are checked as for any of its
// calls, for the same person. Whether an export reads or writes is the
// called App's own declaration. The chain and read-only hold per call,
// by its token: the called App's code could make a call on with the token
// of another call of its own running at the same time, which is within
// that declaration's trust.
