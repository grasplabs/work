// The model gateway: every model call in a deployment goes through here, and

// provider. Core holds no provider key: AI Gateway pays with Workers AI,
// Unified Billing (Cloudflare credits) or the client's own keys stored in
// the gateway, and core reaches it over the AI binding, which needs no token
// either. Every request is audited as metadata only: who or what asked, why,
// the model, tokens and cost, never the prompt or the answer. The event goes
// through the audit outbox, so a request that was answered (and paid for)
// is recorded even when the audit log can't take it for a moment.
//
// Before anything is sent, a call is checked against the deployment's
// allowlist and its other rules (model-rules.ts). A refused call is
// audited too, with the reason, and nothing is sent.

// Google's refuses one, so Google models would need a gateway token over
// HTTPS, and aren't offered.
