// type its name says), recorded as `pending` with its audit event, its
// original stored in R2 (checked against its hash), and its extraction
// started: a run of core's own workflow (extraction.ts) on the engine,
// whose one step extracts the text in a sandbox (extract.ts) and saves it
// as the next version of the document at the file's name, in the save
// pipeline's batch, which marks the upload ready too. The uploader's access
// is checked again just before that save. Whatever fails ends the upload
// failed, with the code of why.
//
// Each upload has an original of its own, kept while the upload is: for
// downloading the original of a document's version, which comes as an
// attachment only (threat model R20). Its delete is recorded outbox-style
// (`upload_cleanups`) in the batch that records the upload, before the
// original is stored, and cleared in the batch that makes the upload
// ready. So an original is deleted whenever its upload doesn't end ready:
// by the failure that fails it, or by the cron trigger once its upload is
// gone (a purge forgot it, say, while its original was still being
// stored) or failed, and old enough that nothing is still storing it.
