/**
 * A collection, as an App's server code holds it:
 * `await this.env.HANDBOOK.getDocument(caller, id)`. Like the App's
 * connection stubs (app-bindings.ts), it acts for no one on its own: each
 * read passes the caller of the App method it runs in, and the App's host
 * says who that is. So a read gets the App's grant intersected with what
 * that person may read, never a personal collection (access.ts), and a
 * read of restricted data puts the App in restricted mode first, for
 * everyone using it.
 *
 * Each stub also reads and writes the collection's records, typed by the
 * record types Apps declare for it (records.ts, record-types.ts): a save
 * (`saveRecord`) only under a permission with `write`, for the caller and
 * with their rights, and says whether it would (`canWrite`), so App
 * screens offer only the changes core takes. A save through a stub whose
 * permission doesn't write is refused by the permission check, and
 * `canWrite` is `false` there.
