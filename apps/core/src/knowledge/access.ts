// (app-entries.ts: these collections, and of the Apps collection only the
// entries of Apps the reader may open), never as a filter afterwards, so
// no path (listing, history, backlinks, search) shows more than a read

// they own. An App or agent reads the collections it has a permission to
// read, never a personal one, and of those only the ones the person it
// acts for may read too
// (R5): a grant never reaches past that person. The one exception is an
// agent's memory (`readableForPerson`), which reads what the person may
// read, without a grant, and only their memory files. What anyone reads is
// marked with where it came from and recorded in the audit log, and
// restricted data puts the chat or App an App or agent works in in
// restricted mode (`noteProvenance`).
