// loopback entrypoint of core whose props core sets for one code run of one
// chat (agent-scope.ts), so the code can call it but never say who it acts
// for. The model sees each API as a TypeScript declaration and writes code
// against it.
//
// An API that reaches a person's data acts as the chat's agent on behalf
// of the chat's person (`chatAuthority`), under the agent's permissions
// and never past what the person may do themselves, checked again on every
// call, with the chat as its context: where restricted mode is kept. Every
// call is recorded in the audit log, by what serves it or as `agent.call`
// (`auditAgentCall`), and what it read from is recorded with the chat
// before the call hands it over (`recordSources`).
