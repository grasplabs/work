 * permission's name: `await this.env.GUESTS.invite(caller, { name, skill

 * method it runs in, and acts for them, only while that call runs. Only
 * a person using the App invites (`guest.invalid` for a workflow run's
 * call, or one through another App's export): the member a chat is made
 * for, and spends the budget of, is always the one who asked for it. The
 * permission is checked again on every call.
