// The one Workflow of a deployment (`WORKFLOWS` in wrangler.jsonc). Every
// run of every App's workflow is an instance of it, tagged with its App,
// workflow and App version (runs.ts). Each time Cloudflare Workflows runs
// an instance, at its start and on every resume, the dispatcher loads it
// afresh: the run's row, who it acts for now, an env built from the App's
// permissions as they are now, and the workflow's code at the run's own
// version. So a run keeps its code when a new version becomes current, and
// a permission revoked while it waited is gone from its next step on.
//
// Who a run acts for (threat model decision Q10): the person who started
// it, or, for a run a trigger started, the App's owner. A run acts for
// nobody who has left, checked at every load and before every step: once
// they have, the run fails, whoever started it.
//
// Core's own workflows run here too (engine.ts): a run tagged with the
// internal workflow it is, not an App version, runs that workflow's code,
// which is core's, with core's env.
//
// A run's parameter values are the ones people set (params.ts), read as
// the version it is pinned to declares them, never the current version:
// so a stored value counts only where that version declares it of that
// kind. The SDK records them in the run's first step, so a run keeps the
// values it started with.
