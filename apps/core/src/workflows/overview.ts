// Every workflow a person can see, across Apps, and their runs: the
// Workflows page, its Runs tab and the workflow view. A person sees the
// workflows and runs of every App they can open (app-access.ts). What
// each run shows them is what `list` shows for one App (`runFor`).
//
// A run waits when it hasn't ended and one of its decisions is still
// open, as answering decides it (`stillOpen`): open, and not past its
// deadline. It goes on once someone answers it, on the decision's own
// page. A run that waits otherwise (a sleep, a feature switched
// off, a decision past its deadline that it hasn't timed out yet) goes on
// by itself, and counts as running.
//
// The queries are written for a D1 without statistics (a fresh one never
// has them), where SQLite picks indexes by the query's shape alone. Each
// list reads one index in the order it returns rows, and stops at a page:
// runs newest first by `workflow_runs_created_idx`, failed runs by
// `workflow_runs_status_ended_idx`, waiting runs from the open decisions
// (`workflow_decisions_status_opened_idx`), one App's runs by its own
// (`workflow_runs_app_idx`, `workflow_runs_app_workflow_idx`), runs that
// haven't ended by status. A filter that must not pick an index of its
// own is written `+column`, which SQLite never looks up by an index: so
// the list of Apps someone sees never turns a page into a sort of every
// run of those Apps. workflow-overview.test.ts checks the plans.
