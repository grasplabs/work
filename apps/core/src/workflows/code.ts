// An App's workflows are its code, written by the agent: they run as its

// empty env: every binding is a call to core's host (host.ts). Each
// isolate loads one version's workflows and the SDK's modules, and a main
// module of core's that connects the one workflow it runs to the engine
// (host.ts) over RPC. Everything in the isolate is untrusted, core's main
// module too: every check is on core's side of the RPC.
//
// A run is pinned to its App version's workflow code. The SDK's modules
// come from the release that runs it, and so does the engine contract
// between them (step names, `$params`): that contract must stay
// the same across releases, or runs started before a release replay
// differently after it. `env.APP` calls the App's current server version,
// as every caller of the App does.
//
// A version's workflows ship with their tests, which run in an isolate of
// their own before the version can be made current. That is a quality
// gate, not a security boundary: code can tell it runs under test.
