// read, checked against the hash.

// change, so a version's files stay exactly as committed whatever happens

// its tree named by no version: rare, and one version's size at most.
//
// Versions are linear: each commit is the latest version with its changes
// over it, as the next number. Two commits at once both try the same
// number, and the database keeps one; the other is refused as a conflict.
