// Model budgets, one of the client's rules for model calls (model-rules.ts):
// what the deployment's calls may cost in a UTC month, all together, per
// workflow and per person, in US dollars at the providers' list prices.
// A call's cost is what its provider reported it used (tokens in and out)
// at the prices in the model catalog (models.ts), the same cost its audit
// event records; for a request that failed or was cancelled mid-answer,
// which the provider didn't count in full, an estimate, which the event
// says (`usedBy`, models.ts).
//
// Before each request a call sends (a retry too), in the month it is
// sent in, it is refused once any of its budgets is used up: the call
// stops at 100%. After each request, its cost is added to each of its
// budgets with one statement per budget, so concurrent calls never lose
// each other's cost. Admins are alerted when a budget's spend reaches its
// alert threshold or its limit, once per month and threshold value: the
// alert is a row in `model_budget_alerts`, keyed by that value and
// inserted only if the spend has reached it and the row isn't there yet,
// and its event is stored only if the insert added the row, in the same
// batch. It runs with every addition, and before each request for a
// budget whose spend has reached a value with no alert yet. So whichever
// call reaches a value, however many run at once, and in whatever order
// the config changes a threshold, each value alerts once a month.
//
// A budget is only checked before a call, whose cost isn't known until it
// is answered: calls already under way when the budget runs out still
// finish, and are counted, so a month's spend can pass its limit by what
// those calls cost.
//
// The alert is an audit event (`model.budget.alert` and
// `model.budget.exhausted`) that admins find in the audit log, and a log
// line: there is no other path to admins yet.
