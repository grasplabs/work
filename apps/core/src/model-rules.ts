// The client's rules for model calls, which the gateway checks on every
// call before anything is sent (models.ts): beyond the allowlist, which
// always applies, whether a call must stay with a model hosted in the EU,
// which models may take sensitive data, and what calls may cost.
//
// The rules are deployment config, part of the `MODEL_GATEWAY` var the
// console sets, like the allowlist: they are what the client agreed to, so
// no admin session can loosen them in the product. A config whose rules
// don't parse refuses every call while they apply (models.ts), and is
// never read while they don't.
//
// They apply whenever they are configured. The rule that keeps the whole
// deployment in the EU also keeps uploads' text extraction in the Worker,
// off Workers AI (knowledge/extract.ts): it is what the client agreed to.
//
// "Hosted in the EU" is the config's word for a model: the client's
// provider serves it in the EU (its EU data residency, with the keys AI
// Gateway stores for it). Every call, one that must stay in the EU too,
// still goes through AI Gateway, which can't be pinned to the EU: it passes
// the request on and logs its metadata only (models.ts). A direct EU route
// comes later, through connect.
//
// A call carries sensitive data when its context is in restricted mode
// (restricted.ts), which is sticky: once a chat or an App has read a
// sensitive collection, everything it sends a model may hold what it read.
// So does a call whose provenance names a sensitive collection, or one of
// its documents, or whose data came from a connection the config marks
// sensitive. Only the models the data rule lists may take such a call.
//
// And budgets: a call is refused once one of its budgets is used up for
// the month (model-budgets.ts).
