// What ships with the release, installed once per release on the first
// request: the built-in blueprints
// (apps/core/blueprints/, embedded by build-blueprints.ts, each the
// blueprint of an ordinary App, app-blueprints.ts), and the Grasp skills
// (knowledge/grasp-skills.ts). Workers have no deploy hook, so the first
// request core serves after the router's check starts the install, in the
// background (`installBuiltinsOnce`), once per isolate.
//
// One object does the installing, the `Builtins` singleton. It keeps the
// fingerprint of the release it last installed completely, a SHA-256 of
// everything the install writes; an unchanged release does nothing beyond
// comparing it. Callers who arrive while it installs share that install.
// The fingerprint is stored only once everything is in, so a partial
// install (a blueprint or a skill that failed, the object evicted
// halfway) is tried again by the next request that starts one. Each part
// compares what is stored before it writes (a blueprint its files, a
// skill its text), so trying again writes only what is still missing.
//
// Which release wins while two run side by side, during a gradual
// rollout: the one the object runs. It installs its own release, never
// the caller's, and a Durable Object runs one version at a time: each
// deployment assigns each object a version. As long as each gradual
// deployment lists the versions in the same order as the one before and
// only raises the new version's share, Cloudflare never moves an object
// back to a version it left, so the installed text changes once when the
// object moves to the new release, never back and forth. The console's
// rollouts must keep to that. A rollback installs the older release
// again, as it should. On-prem runs one version.
//
// An isolate counts the install as done only once the object has
// installed the isolate's own release (`ensureInstalled` compares the
// fingerprints): an isolate of the new release that reaches an object
// still on the old one asks again later, rather than never.
