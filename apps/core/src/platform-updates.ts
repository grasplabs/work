// Platform updates in the client's Activity: every version the console
// deploys carries a `PLATFORM_CHANGE` var (@grasp-os/shared/platform-change)
// saying who changed what. The every-minute cron inserts the version
// running now (the `CF_VERSION_METADATA` binding) into `platform_versions`,
// one row per version ever recorded, and stores `platform.updated` in the
// same batch only if that insert added the row. So each version is
// recorded at most once, however many cron runs see it at the same time,
// and however often isolates of two versions alternate on the cron during
// a gradual rollout. A rollback to a version already recorded is not
// recorded again here: the console tells core of it (`platformUpdatePath`,
// below). The event waits in core's outbox for the cron's drain, this
// run's or the next.
//
// A version made outside the console (a `wrangler deploy`, which keeps the
// vars) carries the previous version's `PLATFORM_CHANGE`; the event names
// the version's own ID and creation time, so a reader can tell. Without
// the var, or with one that doesn't parse, the change is `unknown`.
// Where there is no version metadata (plain workerd, on-prem), nothing is
// recorded. Nor is anything while `platform_versions` doesn't exist yet
// (a version deployed before its migration ran): that is logged once per
// isolate as a warning, and the first run after the migration records the
// version then running.
