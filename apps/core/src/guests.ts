// Guest chats (`@grasp-os/shared/guests`): an App, under a permission an
// admin grants it (`{ type: "platform" }`, `guests`), invites someone who
// isn't a member to a short chat with a model, for one of its people
// (the member its method runs for), guided by one of the release's Grasp
// skills. The guest gets a link; nothing else. How it can fail, and what
// stops it:
//
// - A link guessed, or reused by someone else: its secret is 256 random
//   bits, sent only in the link's fragment (never to a server, a log or a
//   referrer) and to this endpoint in a POST body, and kept here only as
//   its SHA-256. Anyone holding the link is the guest: it is a bearer
//   secret, for one chat, and the member hands it to one person.
// - A link that outlives its purpose: it works until it expires (at most
//   14 days), the App revokes it, or the guest finishes; and only while
//   the App still holds its permission, and the member it was made for
//   is still a member who may use the App. Each is
//   checked on every request, never only at invitation. A revoked link
//   opens nothing at all, not even what was written, however late the
//   revoke lands in a request (what was written is read in one batch
//   with the chat's state); a finished or expired one still shows it,
//   takes nothing more, and can be revoked too.
// - The guest reaching the company's data: the model is called with no
//   tools, only the skill's guidance and the chat so far, through the
//   model gateway (its allowlist, rules and budgets), as the App for the
//   member it was made for. There is no Knowledge, connection, App, memory
//   or agent in reach: nothing is there to read or change.
// - The guest's words taken as instructions later: they are kept as plain
//   text, apart from everything else, and an App reads them back only
//   through its own permission (`readGuest`). Nothing the guest writes
//   goes anywhere on its own; the App gives it to people to review.
// - Cost and load: one turn at a time per chat (a turn claims the chat
//   until it ends, `busy_until`), at most 20 turns of at most 1,000
//   characters, short answers, and the member's model budget; at most 50
//   open chats per App. A turn whose model call failed still counts (the
//   gateway may have billed it), so a chat makes at most 20 model calls.
//   The router limits the endpoint per client address too.
// - Unseen: inviting, revoking and reading back are audited as the App
//   for the member; the guest opening the chat, each message and
//   finishing are audited as the guest; each model call is audited by
//   the gateway.
//
// Chats are deleted 30 days after they end or expire (`sweepGuestChats`):
// ending one moves its expiry to when it ended, so one index finds both.
// What an App made of a chat is the App's, and outlives it only as long
// as that does: a workflow run that read the transcript keeps it as its
// input and in its steps until the run's own retention is over (30 days
// after the run ends, or fewer if the deployment says so,
// workflows/retention.ts), and a record an App saved from it (a Playbook
// source, say) is kept like any record, until it is deleted or purged.
