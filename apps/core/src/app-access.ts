// - its owner, the person who created it, as a builder;
// - the people and teams it is shared with (`app_members`), in the role
//   it is shared with them in; someone in several (as a person and
//   through a team) has the highest.
//
// The person's role in the organization caps their role in an App: only
// admins and builders build, so someone whose role there is `user` works
// in an App's screens at most, even their own App's or one shared with
// them as a builder. Everyone else has no role in the App, and it doesn't
// exist for them (`app.not_found`), just as an App that isn't there.
// Someone an App is shared with is refused too, with `app.unreadable`,
// while it has read data they can't read where it comes from
// (app-provenance.ts).
//
// Roles are read from the database on every call, like the session and
// the person's role and teams (auth/identity.ts), so unsharing, a team
// change or a new role in the organization applies to the next call.
// Grasp staff, who are admins while their window is open, manage Apps as
// admins do, but never share one (app-members.ts): whom a client's data
// reaches is the client's decision.
